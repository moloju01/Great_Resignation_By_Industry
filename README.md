# Great_Resignation_By_Industry

Purpose: For our capstone project, my Data Science For All team decided to focus on the factors affecting the great resignation and the potential differences between industries. We were looking for statistically significant factors that could explain the uptick in resignation and whether the record breaking numbers of resignations could potentially be explained within industry, etc.

Question: What major industries within the U.S. workforce have experienced the most/least resignations and what are the relevant mitigating factors?

Results: Through data analysis using both Python and Tableau, we discovered a significant correlation between healthcare, sick leave, vacation, and compensation on number of resignations recorded.
